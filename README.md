# Machine-Learning-Projects
The below are models that developed on a various datasets with supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
1) In the project Rock vs Mine prediction, I have build a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, I have used Logistic Regression Model for the prediction. 
2) In the project Diabetes prediction, I have build a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, I have used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
3) In the project House price prediction, I have build a House price prediction system using Machine Learning with Python on a Boston house price prediction data. This is an important Machine Learning project & use case and i have used XGBoost regressor for the prediction.
